#processing
- This Python script demonstrates parallel processing using the multiprocessing module to sum elements of a large array efficiently. It splits the array into segments, spawns child processes to sum each segment, and aggregates the results. Finally, it prints the total sum of the array. This script showcases the power of multiprocessing for speeding up computationally intensive tasks.
